Welcome to Sober.Page!
----------------------

Sober.Page is an extension of [Recovery Source](https://handbook.recoverysource.net/)
that provides a **Directory and Domain Services** for [12-Step Support Groups
](https://handbook.recoverysource.net/project/glossary.html#step-group).

What We Offer
-------------

- **Website Directory**:
Check out the main menu for our directory listing of 12-Step Support Group websites.
- **Short URL**:
Every website listed in our directory is assigned a ``subdomain`` which redirects
all requests to your website. This provides a short and memorable alias for your
publications.
- **Free Domains**:
If your 12-Step Support Group does not have a domain, we can provide a ``subdomain``
that you can call your own.
- **Recovery Source Handbook**:
The ``Recovery Source`` project provides a [handbook](https://handbook.recoverysource.net/)
that explains everything a beginner needs in order to deploy and maintain a website
for their 12-Step Sober Support Group.
- **Meeting Data**:
We gather publicly-available meeting data and merge it into a single collection
which developers are free to access as authorative data.

Domain Name
-----------

Sober.Page provides subdomains that can either be used as "short URLs" that
redirect users to an existing 12-Step website or used as the primary URL for
12-Step groups that cannot afford DNS registration.

Potential uses:

- Redirect from a standardized location to your existing domain
- Work on a website rebuild before "going live" with a new site
- Use it as your own website address (ideal with static sites)
- Use sober.page as a "short url" service

Short URL
---------

All ``sobersupport.group`` URLs are also available via ``sober.page``. This
serves as a convenient "Short URL" which should be easier for both memory and
document spacing.

Example: https://aaX.sober.page/meetings
redirects to https://aaX.sobersupport.group/meetings

Our Commitment
--------------

Recovery Source operates in accordance with the [7th Tradition of Alcoholics
Anonymous](https://handbook.recoverysource.net/project/internals.html), dedicated
to assisting 12-Step groups without accepting outside donations or financial
compensation. We are here to support any 12-Step group trying to reach those who
still suffer.
