About Service
-------------

If you are looking for a way to get a basic website running so that you can
effectively maintain meeting data (online, printed, meeting guide, etc.), you
have come to the right place!

[Recovery Source](https://docs.recoverysource.io/) started as an effort to
provide simple websites solutions for 12-Step groups, with a focus on the
accessibility of meeting information. After some time, it became evident that
the target audience needed additional support.

``Sober Page`` aims to provide a basic framework that enables increased
outreach. The services listed on this page are provided by this domain.

Domain Name
-----------

The primary purpose of ``Sober Page`` is to provide a domain name for 12-Step
groups so that they can have an easily accessible website using a standardized
URL pattern.

Domain uses (ex. aa0-1.sobriety.support):

- Redirect from a standardized location to your existing domain
- Work on a website rebuild before "going live" with a new site
- Use it as your own website address (ideal with static sites)

Short URL
---------

All ``sobersupport.group`` URLs are also available via ``sober.page``. This
serves as a convenient "Short URL" which should be easier for both memory and
document spacing.

Example: https://aaX.sober.page/meetings
redirects to https://aaX.sobersupport.group/meetings

Email Forward
-------------

Email forwarding is currently out of scope but may be considered in the future.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is (will be) available at https://docs.recoverysource.io/.
