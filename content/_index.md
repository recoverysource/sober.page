About Service
-------------

[Recovery Source](https://docs.recoverysource.io/) started as an effort to
provide simple website solutions that are trivial to deploy and maintain. After
some time, it became evident that the target audience needed additional support.

``Sober Page`` attempts to bridge this gap by providing the following services.

Domain Name
-----------

The primary purpose of ``Sober Page`` is to provide a 3rd-level domain for
12-Step groups so that they can have an easily accessible website using a
standardized URL pattern.

The domain name provided can be used directly (github pages or similar) or used
as a forward (redirect) to an existing domain, if one is already owned.

Short URL
---------

All ``sobersupport.group`` URLs are also available via ``sober.page``. This
serves as a convenient "Short URL" which should be easier for both memory and
document spacing.

Example: https://aaX.sober.page/meetings
--> https://aaX.sobersupport.group/meetings

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is (will be) available at https://docs.recoverysource.io/.
