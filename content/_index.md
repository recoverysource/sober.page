About Service
-------------

If you are looking for a way to get a basic website running so that you can
effectively maintain meeting data (online, printed, meeting guide, etc.), you
have come to the right place!

[Recovery Source](https://docs.recoverysource.io/) started as an effort to
provide simple websites solutions for 12-Step groups, with a focus on the
accessibility of meeting information. After some time, it became evident that
the target audience needed additional support.

``Sober Page`` aims to provide a basic framework that enables increased
outreach. The services listed on this page are provided by this domain.

Domain Name
-----------

The primary purpose of ``Sober Page`` is to provide a domain name for 12-Step
groups so that they can have an easily accessible website using a standardized
URL pattern (ex. aa0-1.sobriety.support).

Potential uses:

- Redirect from a standardized location to your existing domain
- Work on a website rebuild before "going live" with a new site
- Use it as your own website address (ideal with static sites)
- Use sober.page as a "short url" service

Short URL
---------

All ``sobersupport.group`` URLs are also available via ``sober.page``. This
serves as a convenient "Short URL" which should be easier for both memory and
document spacing.

Example: https://aaX.sober.page/meetings
redirects to https://aaX.sobersupport.group/meetings

Email Forward
-------------

Email forwarding is currently out of scope but may be considered in the future.

Pricing / Agreement
-------------------

This project is designed for 12-Step programs who are struggling to reach those
who are still struggling. We provide basic "website manager" services so that
your group can focus on sharing your presence (meeting information).

This project follows the AA [7th Tradition](https://docs.recoverysource.io/funding.html)
and does not accept outside donations, nor does it accept financial compensation
for the services provided. We will work with any 12-Step group which is committed to
maintaining their own meeting information.
